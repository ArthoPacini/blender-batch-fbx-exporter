# Blender Batch FBX Exporter

This add-on lets you export your selected objects into separate FBX files which will be named according to the objects names in the hierarchy.

## Usage

In object mode, select the objects you wish to export and open the toolbox (Default: Space) and run `Batch Export FBX`. This will export
the selected object to separate files in the same directory as your .blend file.
